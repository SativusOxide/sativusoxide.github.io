                    <p>
                        Since I was young, I have always been interested in the world of computing. I started off slow, forming simple word documents about how much I like cats and until now, where I have been able to build computers from scratch and even developing my own websites. For the last 5 years I have been a customer service representative for Coles Supermarkets, serving the local community their essentials, even during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    <p>
                        Within those 5 years I have also been in and out of university, coming to find a great interest in web development, admiring the innovation of major brands like Samsung, ServiceNow and Google. Aside from education and work, at heart I am a big music and movie buff. Loving the melodies and sounds of artists like Lorde, Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa, to the theatrical masterpieces of Taika Waititi and Christopher Nolan.

                    <p>
                        I hope to work for a positive, sustainable company be it big or small. I would like to be part of or contribute to innovation and evidently be at the forefront of cutting-edge technology. My long-term goal is to hopefully become a senior UX/UI designer, creating my own projects that could help and inspire current and future generations.
